# tracking-tracker
Chrome plugin for visualizing tracking activity

The "dist" folder contains the plugin.

The plan is to try to get the plugin published on Web Store.
It needs to be polished a bit first, though.

## How to install

1. Download this repo
2. Follow the guide "Load an unpacked extension", available [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked). **Make sure to select the "dist" folder**
