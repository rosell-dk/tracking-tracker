We think that given the proper tools, anyone shopping for college or continuing education can find the perfect fit.CampusExplorer.com is the place to begin that great adventure. We have compiled everything you need for a college search, right here in one site.Whether it's a two- or four-year school, a career college or an online program, we have figured out everything from tuition to average temperature. We also have a personalized search function that allows you to set your wish list and explore from there. We even have direct partnerships with schools to put you in touch with admissions officers.Our database today contains information on more than 8,000 schools, and counting. It's accurate. It's easy to use. It's the most comprehensive directory devoted to higher education you'll find anywhere on the web. And it's free!Why did we build CampusExplorer.com?As far as life decisions go, college is a big one. It can determine your career path, your friends, your future.We think it's the kind of decision you want to get right the first time around. But we know that for many students, that's easier said than done.Student-to-counselor ratios are out-of-whack in public school systems around the country. California, for instance, has one college counselor for every 600 students, on average. Elsewhere, you'll hear 1:250 cited as a common counselor-to-student ratio.Valuable and informed college counseling is impossible to come by in those conditions. And even if you're one of the most resourceful kids at school, you've probably already figured out there aren't many free places to look for good, first-hand and objective information on higher-ed opportunities.If you're an adult looking for options to continue your education, you've faced the very same problem.It's hardly surprising, then, that transfer rates at colleges are mounting steadily. According to the US Department of Education, as many as 60% of American college students now attend more than one school before graduating. Experts say the reasons are clear: general dissatisfaction with a school; cost; changing majors; even homesickness.Also evident is the fact that transfers cost us minutes and money, not to mention stress, during a time in our lives that's supposed to be peaceful and positive.We think it's interesting that the transfer rate had been climbing consistently for almost two decades, but just recently skyrocketed – right in the midst of the Information Age. Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that even though there's more information available to us than ever before, sifting through every last byte that comes across our screens can be a major challenge.At Campus Explorer we've done the heavy lifting for you. We've sourced the primary providers of information – the government, the schools themselves, and their students – and made it easy for you to find what is most valuable and relevant.The choice is yours; we just put everything into one place for you.How do you get started?Students: Whether you are just graduating high school, looking for graduate schools, wanting to change careers, getting certified in your trade or looking for a fun night class, Campus Explorer is here to help. We let you search for schools by major or field of study, location, degree type and much more. If you already have a wish list of schools in mind, search by name and dig right into the campus profiles. Watch videos. Cruise through school photos. Calculate your chance of admission. We can also help you compare price tags and track applications. We're here 24/7. Think of us as your personal college counselor.Guidance Counselors: Your students are all very different. You want the best for all of them. At the same time, there are only so many minutes in a school-day. You need one-stop shopping when it comes to college research. We'll help you search through vast quantities of information across thousands of schools. You'll be able to home in quickly on an array of options for a diverse student body and help each student complete his or her plan for the future.Admissions Officers: You want to give an in-depth and rounded view of your school to students across the country, especially to potential applicants in other regions who may be unfamiliar with your program. You may also want to give interested students an easy way to contact you. Use our campus profile pages and our many interactive tools to showcase your school to both students and guidance counselors.Campus Explorer: Find your future.",

As the development team behind the first Ad exchange, RightMedia, we have evolved with the industry from its outset.From 2004 to 2007, IPONWEB built most components of the Right Media platform at least once. Some components had up to 3 complete redesign and builds by different teams. In 2007, Yahoo acquired Right Media, and began to phase out IPONWEB’s involvement. IPONWEB finished working on the Right Media platform in 2009.Since then, we have now contributed to, in part or in entirety, the build and operation of dozens of similar scale projects, and several dozen smaller, but just as algorithmically complex platforms. In total, we have built more than 120 different flavours of trading systems (DSP’s, SSP’s, Exchanges, DMP’s and other acronyms) for many of the biggest names in the industry.80% of our senior team has been with us since those early days, an almost unprecedented achievement in today’s high turnover and competitive Internet environment. We believe we are one of the few companies in the world that have the exposure to the type of engineering challenges that building and operating these platforms represents, not once, not twice, but tens of dozens of times. We know of no other company that can boast of this depth of experience and knowledge in this space.Each IPONWEB solution is unique and proprietary for every customer; but we leverage the collective experience to evolve products & platforms at an unmatched level of scale & sophistication. We have developed a unique methodology, based around our u-Platform technology stack, that delivers a fast, flexible, innovative and definitive solution for platform development in the online media space.This combined with our extensive background in algorithmic refinement and probability modeling gets our customers to market quickly, at high quality, with minimal engineering risk. We save our customers the years of development time, investment, mistakes & learning required to simply gain competitive parity.Importantly though this is just the start of the journey. With IPONWEB as a partner, our customers are able to focus their resources on what really matters, iterating their business and commercial model. Freed from technology limitations, our platforms flexibility and our iterative development processes, allow customers to rapidly evolve unique, market leading technology and proprietary product-sets, customised specifically to meet their future needs.\"",

Time workloads folded, sleepless nights, greasy pizzas in the early hours and there reborn again in February 2015, flying like Romario in 94!Extremely easy to deploy and activate up on the site of our grandparents it is possible to do in 5 minutes! We set up a team ready to help them in this and in any setup (if you need), layout and activation platform at no cost! We want to see you as happy as our other customers!Anyway, back to our story, the folded loads and sleepless nights continue already greasy pizzas least because we want to be here for you for a long time (replaced by sushi)! But best of all is that every day we think and launch products and solutions unique in the market in order to optimize and increase your conversion rate, because we want our customers sell more!There are so many new solutions that often do not our website can keep up our development team! We are the \"The Flash\" innovation !! So ask the news constantly, please !!Join now to our selection of more than 350 customers around the world!

In the early days, Adam Singolda, our Founder & CEO, became passionate about the discovery problem as he realized that people don’t really wake up in the morning thinking about new videos or articles they would like to consume that day. Search could never solve that problem: how can someone search for something they don’t even know exists?In July 2007, Taboola was founded and we began thinking about content consumption patterns, and ways to predict the videos people may like before ever expressing an interest in watching them. It took us 3.5 years to innovate around what became the foundation for Taboola's mathematical predictive engine, Taboola EngageRank™, that later became part of publishers’ workflows given its various optimization capabilities. This algorithmic innovation around video then helped Taboola broaden its solution to recommend articles and slideshows, providing world-leading publishers with a single, ultimate discovery and monetization solution.These days, passionate about connecting people around-the-world with content they may like, there are over 400 of us \"Taboolars\" drilling out recommendations between NY, Pasadena, London, Israel, India and Bangkok. Taboola is widely recognized as the world’s leading content discovery platform, reaching 1B unique visitors and serving over 360 billion recommendations every month.Publishers, marketers, and agencies leverage Taboola to retain users on their site, monetize their traffic and distribute their content to drive high quality audiences.
